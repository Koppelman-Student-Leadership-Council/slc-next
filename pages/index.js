The organization was formed to create a worthwhile experience for business students by providing them with the necessary skills and resources needed to succeed upon graduating from Brooklyn College.

With over 9 years of establishment, SLC continues to create meaningful events, filled with lots of knowledge and fun. Additionally, the council has focused on forging relationships with students, faculty, business clubs, and alumni, in hopes of maintaining a strong Koppelman Community." />
